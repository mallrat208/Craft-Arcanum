psi.introduction=Welcome to Magical Psi, the best spell inscribing magic mod in this side of the universe. Please keep in mind that having Just Enough Items (JEI) or some other method of looking up recipes is essential for playing with Psi, as recipes are not included in this guide. In order to get started spellslinging, you'll need some Psidust. To get Psidust, you need to start by crafting a Rod Constructor and an Alchemical Brass Rod Frame. Place down the Rod Contructor and put the Alchemical Brass Rod Frame in it to construct a very barebones Rod. From there, drop some Redstone Dust in the world. Equip your Rod, point at the dropped items and right click to make your Psidust.
